  MIN build response header
  Given uri=srv_root/index.html and version=HTTP/1.0,
  build the response (contents ignored):

    HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n
    Content-Length: 119\r\n
    \r\n

======================================
PUBLIC
  FULL build response header index
  Given uri=srv_root/index.html and version=HTTP/1.0,
  build the response:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n
    Content-Length: 119\r\n
    \r\n

  And set contents to:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Success!</title>
      </head>
    
      <body>
        <h2>It <i>really</i> works!</h2>
      </body>
    </html>

  WARNING: If this free() fails, it is because you did not
  dynamically allocate and read in the file contents. Instead,
  you still have a hard-coded contents string in build_response()
  that needs replaced.

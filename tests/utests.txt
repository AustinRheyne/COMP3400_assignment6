    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n

  And set contents to:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Success!</title>
      </head>
    
      <body>
        <h2>It <i>really</i> works!</h2>
      </body>
    </html>

  WARNING: If this free() fails, it is because you did not
  dynamically allocate and read in the file contents. Instead,
  you still have a hard-coded contents string in build_response()
  that needs replaced.
